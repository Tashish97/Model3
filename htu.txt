The app is basically dividedin 3 Parts: (1)Data uploading and visualization, (2)Table based Filtering and (3)About page.
1. Upload a file with the available extension(.csv) and select the separator from the 3 Option.
2. Once done uploading click on "Load Variables" button to load the variables, this is needed to trigger activation of Table Filteration as well.
3. The Plots are all available within a single page with variables selection on the left while navigation panel on the center top helps you to quickly swtich between pages. Each page has a dedicated "Plot" button to plot within the 
   respective page.(For example: To do plotting in Page 2 select variables from left hand side under Page-2 and click Plot on Page 2.)
4. Data Analysis can be done using the plots, and Particular plots can be downloaded by clicking the "Camera Icon" over each plot.
5. A report can be generated using 'Download Report' Button.
6. For large dataset(max 5MB) plotting might seem to be slow since there are many reactive values and reactive elements, your patience is appreciated.
7. On the 'Table Page' you can choose the type of filters you want based on the nature of the variables.
8. While downloading a filtered table you have to keep few things thing in mind:
   8.1 Always select Show Entries to All before Downloading.
   8.2 It's important to note that only the section that you see on the page will be snapped as a PDF file, so it's much better to go save as Excel file to save the filtered table.
   8.3 It's the same when large number of features are present.
   8.4 No need to specify any extensions just give the path.
